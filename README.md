# Summary of what I've learned
- From this crash course, I was able to read, write, and work with video files using simple I/O scripting after learning the fundamentals of computer vision.  I experimented with contour and edge detection to find object boundaries and detected lines and circles using the Hough Transform.  The importance of these foundational concepts in creating increasingly complex computer vision applications—which enable practical solutions like automation, interactive systems, and surveillance—was brought to light by comprehending face detection and recognition methods to find and differentiate individual faces.
